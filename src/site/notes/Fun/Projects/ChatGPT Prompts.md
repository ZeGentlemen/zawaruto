Review Text: "Source text"

Task: Your task is to make conceptual and comprehensive flashcards using Anki cloze deletion mark-up. Ensure that each statement is clearly written, easily understandable, and adheres to the specified formatting and reference criteria. 

Formatting Criteria: 
- Construct a table with three columns: "Statements", "Notes", and "Number".
- Each row of the "Statements" column should contain a question and an answer in Anki cloze deletion mark-up, focusing on the question making the person think analytically
- Each row of the "Notes" column should provide additional explanations for the corresponding "Statement". There should be no cloze deletions in this column.
- The "Number" column should serve to number each row, facilitating feedback.

Reference Criteria for each "Statement":
- Restrict each statement to 1 cloze deletions. The cloze deletion hides the answer
- Be as comprehensive as need be but the statement column should not exceed 100 words. Extra information goes in the "Notes" column.
- Keep the text within the cloze deletions be as related to the provided text as possible but do make it compreshensive 
- Each statement must contain a question portion and an answer portion. Cloze deletion should only be used for the question portion
- Keep the question and the answer in the "Statements" column. Keep any additional explanatory information in the "Notes" column.

Example: 
| Statements | Notes | Number |

Answer: Principles of Kidney Selection for Transplantation
Selecting a suitable kidney for transplantation involves key principles like ABO blood group compatibility and HLA matching. ABO blood group compatibility ensures that the donor and recipient have compatible blood types, reducing the risk of immediate rejection. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching is crucial for graft success, as it minimizes the likelihood of immune reactions against the transplanted kidney. Both principles contribute to a successful transplantation by enhancing compatibility and reducing the risk of rejection.

Task: 
- Transform this dense source text into clear, concise bullet points that will be used to create educational flashcards later. Pay particular attention to the key facts and important details in the text. Focus on imaging features of diseases, unique imaging findings, and methods of differentiating similar disease entities.  Exclude historical and technical information.  This information is trivial and doesn’t contribute to the purpose of the educational materials, which is to help the user become a competent radiologist and diagnostician.
- Each bullet point must be able to stand alone. Include the subject of the bulleted statement somewhere in the text.
- Place all the bullet points in a plain text code block.

| 1. Give a brief historical background of Pakistani culture? | The modern nation of Pakistan has inherited a very rich cultural and traditional background going back to the Indus Valley Civilization, 2800 BC-1800 BC. The region that is now Pakistan has in the past been invaded and occupied by many different people, including Elamo-Dravidians, Aryans, Greeks, White Huns, Persians, Arabs, Turks, Afghans, Mongols and various Eurasian groups. There are differences in culture among the different ethnic groups in matters such as dress, food, religion, especially where pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices, pre-Islamic practices are being eroded as time goes by. |
| 2. What do you know about Kot Diji? | Kot Diji is situated between Ranipur and Khairpur on the highway from Hyderabad, at the east bank of the Indus close to Rohri. The discovery of Kot Diji provides evidence that there is civilization before Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. The Kot Diji culture is marked by well-furnished, well-made pottery and houses built of mud-bricks on solid stone foundations. The Harappans borrowed some of the basic cultural elements from Kot Dijians. |
| 3. What is the significance of Harappa in the cultural heritage of Pakistan? | Located 10 km south-west of Lahore, Harappa is reached via Sahiwal, formerly known as Montgomery. Situated beside an earlier course of the Ravi River, Harappa was discovered in 1920-21, but through the ages, the site was quarried for bricks and most of the buildings excavated so far are in poor condition. The cemeteries discovered at Harappa confirm the Indus Valley people buried their dead, many of them wearing finger rings, necklaces of steatite beads, anklets of paste bead, earrings and shell bangles. |
