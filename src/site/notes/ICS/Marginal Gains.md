# Additive Gains vs Compounding Gains
Compounding gains change the state where as additive gains only add 
	e.g getting better at studying = compounding
	getting more resources to study or tuition = additive 
- Test to see if something is additive or compounding 
		- remove it are you gonna stay the same (compounding ) or be worse off (additive ) - immediately 
		- if you study more  hours ( removing those hours will leave you worse off) (applies per subject)
		- compounding gains really process (applies to every subject)
