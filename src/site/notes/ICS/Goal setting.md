- [ ] continue at protecting time lec folder 4
- 6 to 12 months goal 
	- really long term planning not good idea, it is gonna alter or change as time goes on ( a general vision is better suited for this)
- Intention setting is not the same as goal setting
- SMART Goals
	- specific
	- measurable - not too abstract  like "i want to be a better learner" :clown:
	- Acheivable
	- Relevant
	- Time-bound 
	  
# Performance Goals
	> - Performance goals are goals on the way to acheiving an outcome goal (short-term)
- more quantifiable
	- e.g racing entry and exit speed racing lines etc.
- indicatiors (early) that serve as feedback to find mistakes etc.
# Meaningless metrics
==- time you study==
==- cover x amount of content in x amount of ftime==
# Setting performance goals
- think of an ideal person that can achieve this goal what attributes will he have 
  e.g time management skills, leraning efficiency, consistency, procrastination management, stress management(discomfort while studying) etc
- compare him with yourself
- find areas for improvement 
- don't work on heaps of attributes at the same time 2 or 3 only
	e.g time management 
			at the start follow 20 ish percent of my schedule 
			acheive like 50 percent goals 
			 improve on these in like 30 days
- Set goal such that in worst case scenario you acheive it best case scenario you destroy it
	e.g 20 to 30/40 percent
